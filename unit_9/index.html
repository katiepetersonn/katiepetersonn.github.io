			<h2>Who I am</h2>
			<p>I (Katie Peterson) have a very clear goal in mind for 2016: I would like to learn how to code. I am sharing my journey with you through Know the Code. The idea is to share inspiration, resources and tips with like-minded individuals who are learning to code.</p>
			<p>I will be profiling individuals who work withinthe technology industry, gathering insights, busting stereotypes and sharing what I learn.</p> 
			<p>Follow along as I delve into the unknown. </p> 
			<p>Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to offer advice, would like advice or just want to have a chat.</p>

			<h2>What is coding?</h2>
			<p> A computer is essential a collection of on/off switches (transistors). Modern computers contain millions or even billions of transistors, which means an unimaginably large number of combinations</p>
			<p>Binary code is the representation of transistor combinations as ones and zeros, where each digit represents one transistor. Binary code is clustered together in groups of eight to form bytes, e.g 11011010.</p>
			<p> Writing a computer program by typing out billions of ones and zeros would be tediously time-consuming, which is where various programming languages enter the picture. A program is simply a text file, written in a certain programming language, and the code inside a program file is called source code.</p>
			<p> Some of the most popular languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, SQL, PHP, C, C++, Java, Object-C and Perl.</p>

			<h3>Girl Crush #1: Margaret Hamilton</h3>
			<p> Margaret Hamilton begins our Girl Crush feature, where we share with you who we are crushing on within the technology insustry.</p>
			<p>There are numerous names that most people associate with humans landing on the mooon, Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, but Margaret Hamilton is not usually among them. Yet this pioneering women was the lead software developer for Apollo's flight.</p>
			<p>For Hamilton and her team, programming consisted of punching holes in cards to execute certain processes. The cards would be run through a giant Honeywell mainframe computer that would stimulate the Apollo lander, making sure everything functioned as planned.</p>
			<p>Many of the earliest and pioneering programmers were women, learning hands-on to do things that had never been done before.</p>
			<p> Like female coders in today's diversity-challenged tech industry, Hamilton was an outlier. It might be a surprise to some that one of the founding fathers of software development was, in fact, a women.</p>
			<p>Thanks to Hamilton and the work she led, notions of what humanity could do, and be, changed not only the stratosphere but computer science. Software engineering, a concept she pioneered, has found its way from the moon to nearly every human endevour.</p>

			<h3>Girl Crush #2: Marissa Mayer</h3>
			<p> Marissa Mayer is our second Girl Crush. Marissa is the president and CEO of Yahoo!</p>
			<p> Before taking the reins at Yahoo!, she started her career at Google as thecompany's first female engineer.</p>
			<p>She started writing code and overseeing smallteams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.</p>
			<p>A self-described "proud geek", she holds a B.S.in symbolic engineering and an M.S. in Computer Science.</p>
			<p> Mayer was a key player in the design of Google's era-defining homepage; her logic and design sense are now woven into the daily lives of people in every corner of the glove.</p>
			<p>Mayer hopes that the wild growth in technology in her lifetime means that more girls will be inspired to pursue a career in technology.</p>

			<h3>Girl Crush #3: Grace Hopper</h4>
			<p> Grace Hopper was a Navy Admiral and helped to write the first programming languages.</p>
			<p> Hopper was assigned to program the Mark I computer, leading the time that created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language. </p>
			<p>She popularized the term "debugging" after removing a moth from her computer to fix it. </p>
			<p> Hopper was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1991 - becoming the first individual recipent of the honor.</p>
			<p> In addition to her programming accomplishments, Hopper's legacy includes encouraging young people to learn how to program. The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing Conference is a technical conference that encourages women to become part of the world of computing.</p>
