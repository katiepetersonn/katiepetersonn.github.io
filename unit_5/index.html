				<p>Know the Code is where I will be sharing my journey as I learn to code. I hope to inspire other women to learn to code, bust stereotypes and play a part in equalling out the gender inbalance. Follow along as I delve into the unknown. </p>

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I (Katie Peterson) had a very clear goal in mind for 2016: to learn how to code. I am sharing myjourney with you through Know the Code. The idea is to share inspiration, resources and tips with like-minded individuals who are trying to teach themselves to code.</p>
			<p>I will be profiling individuals who work within the technology industry, gathering insights, busting stereotypes and sharing what I learn.</p> 
			<p>Launching in Sydney, Australia, in 2016 we will see how the adventure develops.</p> 
			<p>Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to offer advice, would like advice or just want to have a chat. </p>

			<h3>What is Coding?</h3>
			<p> Coding provides a means of communicating with your computer. When you write code, it tells the computer what to do. </p>
			<p> A computer is essential a collection of on/off switches (transistors). Modern computers contain millions or even billions of transistors, which means an unimaginably large number of combinations.</p>
			<p>Binary code is the representation of transistor combinations as ones and zeros, where each digit represents one transistor. Binary code is clustered together in groups of eight to form bytes, e.g 11011010.</p>
			<p> Writing a computer program by typing out billions of ones and zeros would be tediously time-consuming, which is where various programming languages enter the picture. A program is simply a text file, written in a certain programming language, and the code inside a program file is called source code.</p>
			<p> Some of the most popular languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, SQL, PHP, C, C++, Java, Object-C and Perl.</p>

			<h3>Girl Crush #1: Margaret Hamilton</h3>
			<img id="margarethamilton" src="images/margaret_hamilton.jpg" alt="Margaret Hamilton standing next to source code" title="Margaret Hamilton">
			<p> Margaret Hamilton begins our Girl Crush feature, where we share with you who we are crushing on within the technology insustry.</p>
			<p>There are numerous names that most people associate with humans landing on the mooon, Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, but Margaret Hamilton is not usually among them. Yet this pioneering women was the lead software developer for Apollo's flight.</p>
			<p>For Hamilton and her team, programming consisted of punching holes in cards to execute certain processes. The cards would be run through a giant Honeywell mainframe computer that would stimulate the Apollo lander, making sure everything functioned as planned.</p>
			<p>Many of the earliest and pioneering programmers were women, learning hands-on to do things that had never been done before.</p>
			<p> Like female coders in today's diversity-challenged tech industry, Hamilton was an outlier. It might be a surprise to some that one of the founding fathers of software development was, in fact, a women.</p>
			<p>Thanks to Hamilton and the work she led, notions of what humanity could do, and be, changed not only the stratosphere but computer science. Software engineering, a concept she pioneered, has found its way from the moon to nearly every human endevour.</p>
